				<h3>Subsuface imaging and uncertainty for geosolutions</h3>
				<p>
					As part of the Universty's <a href="https://geosolutions.leeds.ac.uk/">Geosolutions Centre</a>, we are working to improve seismic and geophysical imaging of the subsurface to include realistic estimates of uncertainty, and use these to better frame and test hypotheses about the subsurface.
				</p>

				<img class="figure" src="images/Aluto_tomog_summary_with_slice_below.jpg" width="500">
				<p class="caption">
					<i>V</i><sub>P</sub>/<i>V</i><sub>S</sub> structure beneath Aluto volcano, Ethiopia.  Yellow tetrahedra show the seismic stations used to construct the family of models.  Clay cap (green disc) and topography are shown.  Colour shows the mean <i>V</i><sub>P</sub>/<i>V</i><sub>S</sub> along a latitudinal slice, while the red isosurface shows regions where more than half of models have <i>V</i><sub>P</sub>/<i>V</i><sub>S</sub>&nbsp;>&nbsp;1.8, defining the geothermal reservoir.
				</p>

				<p>
					Building on the work begun in the <a href="#remis">REMIS</a> project, we will use and extend methods to take seismic and other geophysical data and build probabilistic models of subsurface parameters such as <i>V</i><sub>P</sub>/<i>V</i><sub>S</sub>, but also the more fundamental parameters such as fracture density, porosity or permeability which are needed to better understand and make use of the ground.
				</p>
				<p>
					Initially, we plan to take the following approach:

					<ul>
						<li>
							Construct (or use if existing) baseline models of the subsurface from surface-wave dispersion and body-wave travel time measurements with uncertainties from Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) sampling.  This is the most expensive but most accurate method for obtaining these sets of models, and serves as a benchmark.  Sites for this work could include the <a href="https://utahforge.com">Utah FORGE</a> site or <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2018.03.023">Aluto in Ethiopia</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Develop approximate but faster methods such as those using <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2889774">variational inference</a> for use with passive body-wave and surface-wave data, similarly as to what has been done with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggad057">FWI methods</a>, and benchmark the solutions against the &lsquo;gold-standard;&rsquo; McMC solution.
						</li>
						<li>
							Develop the strategy to infer subsurface properties beyond seismic ones, giving full posterior distributions for parameters such as fracture density.
						</li>
						<li>
							In collaboration with project partners, develop the method to incorporate other geophysical data, such as  megnetotelluric measurements or gravity data.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					The project is planned to involve trips to collaborate with researchers in the US and Italy on seismic, magnetotelluric and gravity data, and to develop the work to be useful to academic and industry partners in the field of geothermal power.  At the same time, it will involve travel to international conferences to present the work and build collaborations.

				</p>
				
				<h4>My contribution</h4>
				<p>
					In Leeds, our aim is to test how well our models of mantle convection
					match the present-day state of the Earth.  We will use new observations
					of the small-scale structure of the mantle and compare these with large-scale
					seismic simulations, allowing us to decide which convection models best
					match the real Earth, and thus what the interior of the Earth looked
					like hundreds of millions of years ago.
